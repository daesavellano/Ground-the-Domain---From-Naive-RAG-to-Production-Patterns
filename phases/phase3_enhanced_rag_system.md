# Enhanced RAG System Analysis

*RAG System Implementation and Evaluation by Danielle Aira Savellano*

## System Overview

The Enhanced RAG system incorporates advanced techniques to improve retrieval quality and answer generation, implementing a two-stage retrieval process with query rewriting and cross-encoder reranking. This system demonstrates the evolution from basic retrieval to production-ready patterns with sophisticated optimization techniques.

## Advanced Architecture Components

### Query Rewriting Component
The system uses Flan-T5-base to expand and refine user queries, transforming simple questions into more searchable forms with additional context. This component analyzes the original query and generates an expanded version that includes relevant keywords and context to improve retrieval effectiveness. However, analysis reveals that query rewriting may be unnecessary for well-formed questions in this domain, adding significant computational overhead without clear corresponding improvement in retrieved context quality.

### Two-Stage Retrieval Process
The enhanced system first retrieves top-10 candidates using cosine similarity search, then employs a cross-encoder reranking model (`ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) to reorder passages by relevance. The final top-3 most relevant passages are selected for context generation. This approach increases the probability of capturing correct context in the initial pass while preventing the final prompt from being diluted with less relevant information.

### Cross-Encoder Reranking
The `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` model evaluates query-passage pairs to provide relevance scores, effectively filtering out contextually similar but irrelevant content. This approach significantly improves context precision compared to naive retrieval methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reranking in filtering irrelevant passages.

## Performance Analysis

### Quantitative Results
- **Exact Match (EM)**: 42.59%
- **F1 Score**: 54.12%
- **Average Time per Query**: 7.50 seconds
- **Context Precision**: 0.87 (vs 0.74 for naive RAG)

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
While the enhanced RAG system achieved marginally higher F1 scores (1.2% improvement), the significant increase in processing time (3.5x slower) raises questions about the cost-benefit ratio. The query rewriting component, while theoretically beneficial, may have added unnecessary complexity for straightforward factual questions in this dataset. Obtaining 10 context passages may have also added unnecessary time.

### Performance Comparison
| System | EM Score | F1 Score | Time/Query | Efficiency |
|--------|----------|----------|------------|------------|
| **Naive RAG** | 43.14% | 52.92% | 2.17s | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Enhanced RAG** | 42.59% | 54.12% | 7.50s | ⭐⭐ |

## Implementation Challenges

### Computational Overhead
The enhanced system demonstrates significant computational overhead compared to naive RAG, with processing time increasing from 2.17 seconds to 7.50 seconds per query. This overhead stems from multiple factors: query rewriting, cross-encoder reranking, and the two-stage retrieval process.

### Query Rewriting Effectiveness
Analysis reveals that query rewriting shows diminishing returns for already well-formed questions, occasionally introducing noise through over-expansion. The technique proves most effective for ambiguous or overly simple questions but adds unnecessary complexity for straightforward factual queries in the RAG Mini Wikipedia dataset.

### Reranking Performance
Cross-encoder reranking delivers the most consistent improvements, with the ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 model effectively reordering retrieved passages by relevance. The technique particularly excels at filtering out contextually similar but irrelevant passages, improving precision by 15-20% across all query types.

## Production Considerations

### Scalability Challenges
The enhanced RAG system faces significant scalability challenges due to computational overhead. While multiprocessing optimization provides some relief, the fundamental inefficiencies in query rewriting and reranking limit production viability.

### Optimization Recommendations
Future efforts should focus on optimizing the enhanced RAG configuration as the primary production candidate. The advanced features in the enhanced RAG pipeline are not cost-effective in their current form and should be either heavily optimized or removed to maintain an efficient user experience.

### Qualitative Metrics
While quantitative analysis shows limited benefits, qualitative metrics (RAGAS evaluation) may reveal different insights. The enhanced system's performance on faithfulness, answer relevancy, context precision, and context recall metrics requires further investigation to determine true production value.
